# What I learned in week 2

## *If Statements*

An if statement is a way to use true or false statements in order to execute commands. Use if to have a command execute when result is true. Then use else to have something else execute if the first statement isn't true. Ex...

function eXample(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return true;
  }
  else {
    return false;
  }
}

An if statement can be more than just true or false however. the else if function allows you to use as many arguments as you want to really specify what you are looking for. 

## *Booleans* 

***The boolean operator...***

Booleans can be used when you only have 2 options. Other than that they are very similar to the if statements. A boolean is always true or false. An if statement is technically a boolean operator. It's just a way to check multiple things using true and false. 

## *Functions in parameters*

We did a lot of work with basic functions using new parameters. We got to do some research and learn how to use different math operators to make our conditions true.
